# **Deploying VitePress Documentation to GitHub Pages**

This guide will walk you through deploying your **VitePress** static documentation site to **GitHub Pages**. We will use the `gh-pages` package to push the built site to a `gh-pages` branch on GitHub, where GitHub Pages will automatically host the site.

## **Prerequisites**
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:
- **Node.js** and **pnpm** installed on your machine.
- A **GitHub account** with a repository where you want to host your VitePress documentation site.
- A VitePress site set up and ready for deployment.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Create a GitHub Repository**
1. Go to **GitHub** and create a new repository (e.g., `my-vitepress-docs`).
2. Initialize the repository with a **README** file and **public visibility**.
3. Copy the URL of the repository (e.g., `https://github.com/username/my-vitepress-docs.git`).

### **2. Set the `base` URL in VitePress Configuration**
To ensure your VitePress site is correctly deployed to GitHub Pages, update the `base` option in your `vite.config.js` file to match your repository's path.

1. Open `vite.config.js` in the root of your project.
2. Set the `base` option to your repository name (this is the path where GitHub Pages will serve your site from):

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/my-vitepress-docs/',  // Replace with your GitHub repository name
})
```

**Explanation**:
- `base: '/my-vitepress-docs/'`: This ensures that all assets are correctly linked when deployed to GitHub Pages (hosted under `https://username.github.io/my-vitepress-docs/`).

### **3. Build the VitePress Site**
To prepare your VitePress site for deployment, you need to build the static files.

Run the following command to build your site:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

By default, VitePress will output the built site to the **`.vitepress/dist/`** folder.

### **4. Install `gh-pages` for Deployment**
The `gh-pages` package simplifies deploying your site to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

1. Install `gh-pages` as a development dependency:

```bash
pnpm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

2. Add a `deploy` script to your `package.json` to automate the deployment process:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vitepress",
  "build": "vitepress build",
  "preview": "vitepress preview",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d .vitepress/dist"
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `gh-pages -d .vitepress/dist`: This command deploys the content of `.vitepress/dist/` (the built static files) to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

### **5. Deploy to GitHub Pages**
Now you can deploy your VitePress site to GitHub Pages.

Run the `deploy` script:

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

This will push the built site from `.vitepress/dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.

### **6. Configure GitHub Pages**
Once the deployment is complete, configure GitHub Pages to serve your site from the `gh-pages` branch.

1. Go to your **GitHub repository** (e.g., `https://github.com/username/my-vitepress-docs`).
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
4. Under the **Source** dropdown, select the **`gh-pages`** branch and click **Save**.

GitHub Pages will now serve your VitePress site at:

```
https://username.github.io/my-vitepress-docs/
```

### **7. Automate Deployment Using GitHub Actions (Optional)**

You can automate the deployment process using **GitHub Actions**, so your site is automatically built and deployed whenever you push changes to your `main` branch.

1. Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your project root with the following content:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger deployment on push to the main branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Build VitePress Site
        run: pnpm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        run: pnpm run deploy
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

2. **Explanation**:
   - This GitHub Action workflow will automatically deploy your VitePress site to GitHub Pages whenever you push changes to the `main` branch.
   - The workflow checks out your code, installs dependencies, builds the site, and deploys the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

3. **Push the Workflow**: Commit and push the `.github` folder to your repository. GitHub Actions will now automatically deploy your site every time you push to the `main` branch.

### **8. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

- **404 Error on GitHub Pages**:
  - If your site returns a 404 error after deployment, check the `base` URL in your `vite.config.js` file. Ensure the `base` path is set to `/repository-name/`, where `repository-name` is the name of your GitHub repository.
  - If using custom domains, make sure you configure the `CNAME` file and DNS settings correctly.

- **Ensure Remote `origin` is Set Correctly**:
  - Verify that the `origin` remote points to the correct GitHub repository:
  
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```

  If needed, set the correct remote URL:

  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/my-vitepress-docs.git
  ```

- **Failed Deployments**:
  - If the deployment fails, check the build logs in GitHub Actions or your terminal for specific errors.
  - Ensure that `gh-pages` is installed correctly and that the branch is pushed to the correct remote repository.

### **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you have successfully deployed your **VitePress** documentation site to **GitHub Pages**. This setup allows you to maintain and deploy static documentation easily, with automatic deployment available through **GitHub Actions**.

- **VitePress** ensures fast builds and easy deployment, making it a great choice for modern documentation sites.
- **GitHub Pages** provides a free and reliable hosting solution for static sites.
