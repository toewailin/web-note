### Recommended Port Range for Your Project:

1. **Port Range:** `1024-49151`

   * **Why?**:

     * Ports **below 1024** are privileged ports, and on most systems, non-root users can’t bind to these.
     * Ports **from 1024 to 49151** are registered ports. These ports are generally safe to use for custom services (like your app), and they are not reserved for system services or ephemeral ports.
     * **49152 to 65535** are ephemeral ports (dynamic ports used for client-side communication), so you want to avoid those as well.

2. **Additional Consideration:**

   * The port should **not conflict** with commonly used ports like `80` (HTTP), `443` (HTTPS), or `3000` (React development), etc. It’s good practice to avoid well-known ports unless you specifically want to use them.

3. **Final Range to Use:**

   * **Port Range:** `1024-49151`
   * This range provides enough flexibility and avoids conflicts with system services, reserved ports, and ephemeral ports.
