🔍 1. Pick Your Stack

Decide which skills you'll apply with. For web dev, this usually means:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript + frameworks (React, Vue, or Angular)

Backend: Node.js, PHP, Python (Flask, Django), Ruby, etc.

Full Stack: Mix of both

Extras (Nice to have): Git, REST APIs, SQL/NoSQL, Docker, GraphQL


📌 Tip: If you're not confident yet, start small—build some solid portfolio projects first.

💼 2. Prepare Your Profile

Make sure your online presence is sharp:

GitHub: Upload your personal or team projects with clean code and README

LinkedIn: Highlight your skills, stack, and interest in remote roles

Portfolio Website (optional but powerful): Showcase your best projects, resume, and contact



---

📝 3. Create a Solid Resume

Keep it clear, concise, and focused on:

Tech stack

Projects (describe what you did)

Soft skills (teamwork, problem-solving, etc.)

Remote-readiness (e.g., async communication, self-management)


Let me know if you want a resume template!

🤝 5. Apply Smart

Don't mass apply. Instead:

Tailor your cover letter (short but personal)

Mention why remote + why that company

Attach your best projects

Ask for referrals if you see a contact at the company on LinkedIn



---

🎯 6. Prepare for Remote Interviews

Expect questions like:

“How do you manage your time working remotely?”

“Have you worked with remote teams before?”

“How do you communicate during remote work?”


Also, be ready for technical tasks: coding tests or building small apps.


---

🧠 7. Upskill While Applying

While waiting, improve your skills:

Practice on LeetCode or HackerRank

Build 1–2 more projects (show what you can do)

Try contributing to open-source on GitHub



---

✅ 8. Be Consistent

Remote jobs are competitive. You might apply to 20–30+ before getting interviews. Keep going — each application is practice.
